        <p>
          Our story begins in the misty mountains of Yemen, where coffee was
          first cultivated over 500 years ago. In 2018, our founder Ahmed Lutfi,
          a coffee historian and third-generation roaster, trekked through the
          Haraz Mountains and discovered families still growing coffee using
          methods unchanged since the 15th century. <br />
          We witnessed something tragic - the world had forgotten Yemen's coffee
          legacy. While the term "mocha" originated from Yemen's Al-Makha port,
          today less than 1% of global coffee comes from its terraced farms.
          Most Yemeni farmers were abandoning coffee for qat cultivation due to
          unfair trade practices. That journey became BlackCoffee. We partner
          directly with 12 smallholder farms in the Sana'a, Hajjah, and Dhamar
          regions, paying 3x fair trade prices to revive authentic cultivation.
          Our farmers still:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hand-pick only ripest cherries.</li>
          <li>Sun-dry on ancient stone terraces</li>
          <li>
            Process using traditional camel-skin methods (for certain premium
            lots)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each harvest, we navigate war-torn supply chains to bring these
          treasures to your cup. Unlike commercial coffees, our beans develop
          naturally for 2 years in Yemen's high-altitude climate, creating their
          legendary wine-like complexity.

          <h3>What will you hear about us:</h3>
          <p>
            "In a world of mass-produced coffee, BlackCoffee stands as a
            revelation—a rare bridge between ancient tradition and
            uncompromising quality. Their Mocha Mattari is nothing short of
            spectacular: a symphony of dark chocolate, wild honey, and that
            unmistakable Yemeni terroir that lingers like a whispered secret.
            What truly sets them apart isn’t just the coffee’s depth, but the
            story in every sip—each bean carries the care of Yemeni farmers
            who’ve preserved methods unchanged for centuries. This isn’t merely
            a brew; it’s a pilgrimage to coffee’s forgotten birthplace. Few
            brands can claim such purity of purpose and flavor. Qahwat Al-Yaman
            doesn’t just sell coffee; they resurrect history."
